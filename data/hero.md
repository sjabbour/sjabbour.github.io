I am a sixth-year PhD Candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Michigan and a visiting academic at New York University (NYU). I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Jenna Wiens](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wiensj/) and [David Fouhey](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fouhey/). I have also had the pleasure of working with [Cliff Wong](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/clwon/) and [Jeya Maria Jose Valanarasu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jevalanarasu/) at Microsoft Research, and [Mohamed Mostagir](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/mohamed-mostagir) as an undergrad in the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. 

**I am on the academic and industry job markets this year. Please reach out if you think I might be a good fit!**
