## Research Interests

I design multimodal AI systems that help humans reason and make decisions in complex, high-stakes environments. My work bridges machine learning, computer vision, and human–AI interaction.


- **Multimodal AI:** I develop models that integrate diverse data types (e.g., images, time-series, tabular data) to better capture complex real-world phenomena.
- **Generalization under distribution shift:** AI systems often fail when deployed in new environments. I study methods to improve robustness and reliability, especially in settings where human over-reliance on AI can have serious consequences.
- **AI explainability:** Existing explanation tools for vision models (like saliency maps) are often too low-level for domain experts. I create generative, concept-based explanation methods that align more naturally with human reasoning. 
- **Human–AI collaboration:** Understanding how AI shapes real decisions is critical. I’ve led large-scale randomized studies across 13 U.S. states (750+ clinicians, 15,000+ minutes of clinician interaction) to evaluate how AI assistance changes diagnostic and treatment behavior.
