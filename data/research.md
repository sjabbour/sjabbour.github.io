## Research Interests

I am interested in building AI that can help humans make better decisions. My work spans machine learning, computer vision, and human-AI interaction with a focus on AI for healthcare. I have done this in three focus areas: 

- **Generalization under distribution shift:** AI models peform well when applied to in-distribution data, but break in new settings (e.g., new hospitals). I design methods for more robust models, even under new conditions. 
- **AI explainability:** Current explanation methods for vision models are pixel-based (e.g., salience maps), but are difficult to understand for expert users (e.g., clinicians). I develop generative AI–driven approaches that provide concept-level explanations for image models.

- **Human–AI collaboration:** Few studies have been done to understand how AI actually impacts clinical decisions. I conduct large-scale randomized studies (750+ clinicians) on real patient cases to measure how AI interventions affect clinical decisions.
